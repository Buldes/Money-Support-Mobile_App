## [0.2.1 Early Acess] - 2024-03-19
 
Small update, that added some few features. 

The new features can cause **more loading time**, because everything is calculated at the beginning, when you start the app, or when you add a new entry. The calculation time is based on youre device and amount of entry in the last 12 months, so it can vary a lot. 

You can enable/disable this feature, if you want, but I would be happy if you **give them a testet and bring feedbag.**
